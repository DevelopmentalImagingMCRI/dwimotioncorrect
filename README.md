# Enhanced DWI motion correction

The repository contains the implementation of an enhanced version
of the FSL eddy correct tool that is designed to reduce registration
bias observed at b=3000. The method was described in:

_Improved Accuracy of Motion and Affine Eddy Current Distortion Correction in High B-Value Diffusion Weighted Imaging Using Brain Mask Based Weighting Functions_, Christopher Leslie Adamson, Richard Beare, Deanne Thompson, and Marc Seal, ISMRM 21st Annual Meeting and Exhibition, April 2013.

## Prerequisites

_DWIEddyCorrectMI_ is a python script with the following dependencies.
